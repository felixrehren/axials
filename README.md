# Axial algebras and representations
## a GAP package

This package is built to work with so-called axial algebras:
a class of nonassociative algebras
carrying representations of transposition groups.
A particular application is to Majorana theory and hence the Monster.

It requires the Transposition Groups package,
available at http://github.com/felixrehren/trgps.

To get started,
install the files to your GAP packages directory.
For me, that's in `~/.gap/pkg/`.
